        <span> This is one of my papers in my Composition class about Bitcoin. Although there are still some errors, I
            think it is great to share some opinions in here: </span>

        <p>
            According to a poll from Bloomberg, only 42 percent of people identify Bitcoin as a virtual currency while
            others are not sure. In another survey from Wired, about 62% of respondents believes Bitcoin is a fraud.
            Whereas many people still reject Bitcoin as a hoax and scam, or asset bubble for some economists, its
            ability or at least fundamental concept should be recognized as the next significant technology shift due
            to its benefit in both economic and political concern. This essay will first summarize information about
            how Bitcoin works, and then points out what other people oppose as well as the explanation for my claim
            in term of technology, economics, and politics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bitcoin is all over the headings and news of thefts, FBI, and banks, but not a lot of people know what it
            is. With the highest value of three thousand dollars recently, the triumph of Bitcoin was challenging.
            Bitcoin is one of the first and the most prominent of the rising family of so-called “cryptocurrency.”
            According to Oxford Dictionary, cryptocurrency is “A digital currency in which encryption techniques are
            used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating
            independently of a central bank.”. Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese, is commonly believed to be the founder
            of Bitcoin who started this rational idea in 2008. Bitcoin is a currency with peer-to-peer and decentralize
            network. In other words, it is transferred by systems of computer with no one being the director. Its
            principal notions are validity of transactions and generation of the currency itself. Thousands of
            computers or miners will be considered as nodes, and solve complicated mathematical issues to guarantee
            the security of the transaction. Once completed, fixed amount of new coins is created, and miners will
            get it. Besides, its birth with transaction guaranteeing authenticity will be announced to the block
            chain, which is the history book recording every transaction from the beginning. In addition, the number
            of bitcoin that could be mined will be half every four years, and its limit of 21 million will reach in
            2040. Therefore, the computing algorithm get more complicated and harder to be mined. Another thing to
            notice about Bitcoin is its anonymousness. You do not need your name as well as any other personal
            information. Unlike bank, you only use your bitcoin address for transaction and everything. In short,
            bitcoin’s owners are shareholders in the company, which provides financial services, earns revenue through
            transaction fees and pays a salary to its employees, the miners, but no one is in charge.
        </p>

        <p>
            To begin with, Bitcoin’s idea on cyber security is tremendous. Bitcoin is an open source protocol. In
            other words, it is public, and everyone could get access to it, and download it. Google Android operating
            system, computer operating system Linux or web browser Firefox are also great example of this system.
            Because it is global, everyone can try to hack or exploit the system such as finding the problem with code.
            Yet, there has not any actual hacker that endanger Bitcoin’s structure. Probably, some people will ask why
            some people and companies lost their Bitcoins unreasonably. The most well-known bitcoin hacking happened in
            2014. Mt. Gox was one of the largest Bitcoin exchange services, and they lost nearly 500 million worth as
            well as filed for bankruptcy protection. In the other case, in October 2013, online wallet service
            inputs.io was hacked. They lost more than four thousand bitcoins which worth about $1.2 million at that
            time. It is true that these events happened, but these hackers cannot do anything to the system. Everything
            they could do is taking all the bitcoin, and sending it to their account. In another way, hacker can try to
            steal money from a single account, but that is everything they are able to. The reason behind this is easy
            to understand. Bitcoin is decentralized. The creator does not even have the control over the system, and
            there is no specific people, place, company, server, or government controlling it. Obviously, the hacker
            cannot hack if there is not a target or place. Certainly, you cannot attack a server without knowing where
            it is. Indeed, it is theoretically assumed that you can exploit the inside of system by verify faking
            transaction as true block chain. Your computer must beat all other computers combined on the world by
            the ability to calculate. Undoubtedly, it is technically impossible to have that computer at the current
            time. In addition, another significant innovation is storage. Although it is a digital currency, it can be
            stored with or without internet. The most popular way is online wallet, but it will require some sort of
            identification. Coinbase, Xapo or Circle will be notable candidates. The tougher way is using hardware,
            or offline, but it requires more effort. Trezor hardware or Ledger USB wallet will be noteworthy opponents.
            To wrap up, the notion of an open source and decentralized is a crucial step in cyber world as it is
            impossible for hackers to do anything.
        </p>

        <p>
            Following that, the most common question for Bitcoin will be its meaning in the currency system’s history.
            In the beginning, people start to trade by goods such as a cow for a buffalo. Because it is hard to
            exchange a part of your goods like half of a dog, people start to use gold and silver. As people found it
            hard to divide an amount of gold, people start to think of money, paper receipt or claim for the gold.
            Oxford Dictionary defines money as “A current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes.” In
            order words, money does not have any value, but it stands for value. If we go to the moon, a 100-dollar
            bill is just a paper, and has less value than a piece of bread. Similarly, Bitcoin is meaningless in worth,
            but it is more like an update of money. The first advantage of Bitcoin over money is its convenience. You
            do not have to always hold an amount of cash or coin in your wallet, but only your Bitcoin address. Many
            people will say that it is no longer a problem now with the development of bank and credit card. Yet, the
            service is expensive and slow. Almost every bank in world have annual or monthly fee for maintenance which
            cost about several hundred dollars. It you want to get cash, you might be charged from two to five percent
            of your bill. Moreover, a fee ranging from one to three percent is added to transfer money oversea.
            Besides, buying something straightaway might cost a convenience fee of 2.75 percent, or a waiting time of
            several days. On the other side, Bitcoin transaction fee only varies from several cents to about one dollar
            to transact money around the world, and it does not have any extra fee. Its advantage about price and time
            clearly outweigh money. Further on, the biggest difference between money and Bitcoin is government’s
            publication. A paper is considered money if and only if the government authorizes it. Hence, the government
            can decide when to print, distribute, and regulate it. Oppositely, Bitcoin is not imitated by any
            government, but it is still usable. Consequently, money value is more affected by government whereas the
            whole community determines Bitcoin value. In economic, money tend to inflate while Bitcoin is inflation
            proof. For example, one Zimbabwean dollar equals to 1.47 US dollar in 1980. Because of a trillion-inflation
            rate, one dollar equals to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars in 2015. On the contrary, one Bitcoin equals
            to several cents in the beginning, but it is worth more than 2000 dollar in 2017. Lastly, we cannot make
            fake Bitcoin. While counterfeit money is made secretly by criminals, faking Bitcoin is impossible as
            mentioned above. In short, Bitcoin’s convenience and invulnerability from authority prove its’ superior over money.
        </p>

        <p>
            To continue, with an unstable economics and politics around the world, Bitcoin is trusted to be an
            alternative. Most cases happen in poor countries and countries at war. Venezuela is a notable sample.
            People in Venezuela is having problems with the dictator government along with the high inflation rate
            and economic chaos. Besides, the government has also enforced strict foreign exchange control. Therefore,
            many Venezuelans swap bolivars for Bitcoins to use it for daily life and preserve their property if a
            collapse occurs. Similarly, the inflation rate of more than 30 percent in 2014 makes people in Argentina
            favor Bitcoin. Yet, many people criticize its free platform for being a heaven for illegal activities.
            Charlie Shrem was sentenced for two years for laundering money on Silk Road, which is a forbidden website
            in Deep Web. Another massive cyberattack of WannaCry ransomware locks down victims’ computers and ask them
            to pay in Bitcoin. Indeed, it is true that Bitcoin platform is a paradise for drug dealer, hacker, or
            money launderer. As a result, it has been banned in some countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, or Bangladesh.
            Nevertheless, Bitcoin has put pressure on government for a newer legal currency. Maybe, the mix concept of
            decentralized or less control will be applied. In fact, some companies have applied this notion. Uber has
            broken government’s control over taxi industry while making it easy for anyone to hail a car and other to
            become a driver. In the same way, Amazon, eBay, or Airbnb are principally marketplace operators for
            independent buyers and sellers. In return, they extract fees, put minimal limits, and rarely provide their
            users’ personal information to the government.
        </p>

        <p>
            What’s more, Bitcoin shows economics and political viewpoint of the people. Bitcoin value is the one of the
            most fluctuated and unpredictable currency. Even its main website bitcoin.org states that “The price of a
            bitcoin can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel
            nature, and sometimes illiquid markets.” Beginning with several cents worth in 2009, it faced the first
            “bubble” in the second half of 2011 when it varied from more than 30 dollars to only two dollars. After
            that, its first highest of all time happened around early 2014 with the price of more than 1200 dollars.
            The price experiences a down turn for a long period with the peak of around 200 dollars in 2015 before
            getting back to 1000 dollars in three years. Incredibly, it reached its all-time high of 3000 in June 2017,
            and go up and down between 2500 dollars. Its average one-day change despite its rising and falling was
            nearly five percent. By some means, the fluctuation is increasingly associating with major political and
            economic events. Bitstamp, an exchange company, was hacked and Bitcoin’s price declined by half in a short
            time. In addition, the controversy 2016 US election made Bitcoin soar to 1000 dollar. Its price also
            skyrocketed after the recent UK and France election. With the unpredicted world nowadays, Bitcoin is a
            great tool to preserve their property, and show general perspective of people worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
            To sum up, it is true to say that Bitcoin has some weakness due to its unstable price and illegal
            activities. Yet, it is also wrong to not consider its fundamental advantage. The peer-to-peer concept is
            substantial in the cyber security as it makes hackers powerless. Moreover, Bitcoin’s usability should be
            considered a striking upgrade of money. Lastly, the demand on the government for the newer currency with
            the application of decentralized idea, and block of illegal activities is the most meaningful. Certainly,
            the emerge of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Ripple is pushing the pressure stronger and stronger.
