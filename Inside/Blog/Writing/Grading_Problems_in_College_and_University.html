        <span> This is one of my papers in my Composition class back in my freshmen year. Although there are still some
            English errors, I think it is great to share some opinions about the "A B C D" grading system in the US in
            general: </span>

        <p>
            It was near the final exam for a biology class at Dakota State University which was worth a tenth in the
            overall grade. Alex calculated that his weighted average grade was 82 percent, and he needed an eight of
            ten in the final to get an A while Zach evaluated his average grade was 79 percent, and he needed one of
            ten in the final to get an B because if he did well on the test, and had ten out of ten, he also got an B.
            Unfortunately, Alex got seven out of ten due to several incorrect answers, and got 89 percent in the average
            grade whereas Zach did not have to study, easily got two out of ten, and got 81 percent in the average
            grade. Similarly, due to the grading scale in most colleges and university in American, they both got an B
            with a three in GPA. The huge gap of ten percent among A, B, C, and D raises a question about the grading
            system of many schools in USA. Was it fair when Alex had to pay significant effort while Zach did not even
            try, but they got the equivalent grade? This article will address the matter with universities and colleges
            using grading system of four, and propose various possible solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            To begin with, the grading system from A to D with an F has three significant matters. Firstly, the huge
            gap of ten percent for each letter is exceedingly giant, ridiculously general and nonsense. For some
            classes that the professor prefers calculating the whole process such as Math or English, it can be equal
            to tons of quiz, or two or three small test. For some professors that emphasize principally on the test
            such as Art class, it can sum up to a substantial test or a notable part of the final exam. However, when
            professors evaluate the grade, students who do not complete two or three tests is identical to the one that
            do two or three tests. Therefore, it proves the inequality. It is only beneficial for those students who
            are lazy, but it is a significant disadvantage for those who are willing to learn more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, the gap leads to another problem. It contradicts to the goal of study in colleges which must provide
            incentives for students to learn, and gain knowledge and skills instead of making them less motivation to
            know more. Knowing that Alex has an 83 percent in a particular class, he will only strive to get a high
            score on his final if there is a potential for his final exam grade to boost his overall grade to an A.
            Otherwise, if he figures that no matter how hard he tries for the final, he will not be able to change it,
            he will certainly not do that, and except the grade as it is a waste of time and meaningless. In addition,
            it counters the fundamental political and economic targets of America which are democracy and capitalism.
            In other words, the more people work, the more they earn. Unlike communism or socialism, people who labor
            intensively receive the same money and outcome as those who do not or work inefficiently. Applying a
            similar model to an education system, students that are interested in the subject, and willing to learn
            more should get higher scores in average than those who do not.
        </p>

        <p>
            Following that, the grading system from A to D makes people misunderstand about the appropriate ability
            of students. According to Wikipedia, a famous encyclopedia that attracts millions of people every day, "A"
            corresponds to mastery or advanced, "B" to above average, “C" to average, "D" to poor, and “F” to failing.
            Apparently, Tom who has 90,01 percent in average will get an A, and be considered as mastery while John who
            gets 89,99 percent in total will have an B, and be regarded as above average for most people. Obviously,
            0,02 percent which can be compared to a minor question in the test or the small quiz has changed the whole
            concept of people between mastery and above average. Indeed, if people look at 90,01 and 89,99 percent in
            overall, they will say that these points are similar and trivial. Therefore, A and B or B and C has made a
            significant misunderstanding about the different level of student for both professors, parents, and company
            but it is not always correct. In addition, it creates detrimental impact that grade is a currency, the
            powerful and meaningful symbol. For instance, A and B are considered as superb whereas C and D are rated
            as substandard. In a more perspicuous way, students are encourage to get higher scores to be regarded as
            superior rather than acquiring knowledge and improving real capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
            To deal with grading system from A to D, there are two possible solutions. Education system can use the
            better approach of grading system of plus and minus. A plus is from 97 to 100, A is from 93 to below 97,
            A minus is from 90 to below 93 and so on for other letters. In addition, A plus and A are four in GPA, A
            minus is 3.67 in GPA, B plus is 3.33 in GPA and so on. The best example for this system is Harvard
            university, a prominent university. It directly minimizes all three problems. Plus, and minus lower the
            gap of ten percent into three and four percent. It is not high or low which equals to a part of small test
            or about three quizzes or only a tiny part of the final exam. Besides, it reduces chances that lazy student
            get the same score with hard-working student. Therefore, it triggers students to always try, excel, and
            avoid giving up. They always have probability of earn better grade in GPA as the gap’s influence is slight.
            It supports the concept of doing more and earning more. Moreover, it is more logical to value students’
            understanding. Because it provides a larger scope to evaluate scores, it decreases misconception about
            ability. In the other hand, the disadvantage of this method is that it only lessens the matters, but it
            does not eliminate it completely.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most efficiently method is that colleges only calculate the average score of 100 point, and then
            transfer to the scale four but do not match any letter grades, round up or round down. For instance, Jack
            got 87.5 percent in overall so he will get 3.5 in GPA precisely. As an illustration, Dutch education system
            which is ranked in top ten of education in the world also uses this grading system. This approach can remove
            all three troubles. There will be no gap of ten percent or three percent, and thus, lazy students will
            never get high score. It is appropriate with capitalism as it maximizes motivation for every student to
            try harder and earn more. All tests, quizzes and homework have an impact on the overall score so students
            always have possibility of higher scores. Furthermore, it gets rid of the misunderstanding of outstanding
            , average, or poor. Study is the relative process, and it is not an absolute process. Therefore, teachers,
            professors, parents, and students can judge and determine the scores depending on their own opinions. In the
            contrary, because every wrong answer decreases the general score, it may sometimes cause less incentive for
            student, and give them less chance to re-do it.
        </p>

        <p>
            To sum up, the grading system from A to D has three notable problems. The huge gap of ten percent is
            exceedingly high and nonsense which makes less enthusiasm for students to keep trying. It also makes
            misinterpretation about the ability of students based on grade letters. Using the grade letters with a plus
            or minus is a suggestion to cope with these problems as it can reduce the gap, and encourage them to attempt
            more. A superlative approach is using the ten-point grading scale to eliminate the gap and inspire them to
            pay more effort to every exam and homework in class.
